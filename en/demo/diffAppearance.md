For ibus on Linux, it is limited by the ibus configuration used on different platforms and cannot be modified. However, you can use the system's styles. For example, GNOME.

Next, let's take a look at the appearance on Windows and macOS.

## Appearance in macOS
First, let's talk about macOS. Squirrel adapts to the light and dark APIs provided by the system. Therefore, Squirrel can respond to different appearances based on the current system appearance.

## Appearance in Windows
Next, on Windows; the system API interfaces on Windows are somewhat chaotic. It was only in the later stages of Windows 10 that the dark mode started to become more refined. Rime supports following the system's dark mode starting from version 0.15.

However, please note:
- Starting from version 0.15, Windows 8 and earlier versions are no longer supported.
- Version 0.15 is a major update that adds many features and optimizes many internal components, but it currently does not support the Arm64 architecture version of Windows.

Due to the limitations of my Windows virtual machine (Arm64), the text in the screenshots may have some loss of precision and appear blurry.

## Appearance in Linux
As mentioned earlier, **if Linux uses ibus, it is limited by the system style and cannot be customized.** For example, using this input method configuration on GNOME:
