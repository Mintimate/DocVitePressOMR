Here is an English translation of the Rime configuration tutorial:

# Configuration Tutorial

Now, let's start configuring Oh-my-rime for Rime. Actually the configuration is quite simple. You just need to download and install Rime for your current system, then import Oh-my-rime and redeploy.

Of course, if you want to customize based on your preferences first, it may be a bit difficult for beginners. It is recommended to learn more with search engines and Rime official docs while following this document.

If you find this document or Oh-my-rime Pinyin useful, you can buy me a coffee:
